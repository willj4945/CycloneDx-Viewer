# SBOM Visualization Tool

This project provides a simple, interactive web application to visualize Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data in the form of JSON files. Users can upload an SBOM JSON, view its metadata and components in a table, search and sort the components, and download the table data in CSV format for further analysis.

## Features

- **Upload SBOM JSON**: Allows users to upload a valid SBOM JSON file.

- **Search & Sort**: Users can search and sort the components by name, version, and other attributes.
- **Download CSV**: Users can download the displayed component data as a CSV file for reporting or analysis.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
