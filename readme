# SBOM Visualization Tool

This project provides a simple, interactive web application to visualize Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data in the form of JSON files. It allows users to upload an SBOM JSON, view its metadata and components in a table, search and sort the components, and download the table data in CSV format.

## Features

- **Upload SBOM JSON**: Allows users to upload a valid SBOM JSON file.
- **Visualize Metadata and Components**: Displays the metadata and components of the SBOM in an interactive table.
- **Search & Sort**: Users can search and sort the components by name, version, and other attributes.
- **Download CSV**: Users can download the displayed component data as a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- No backend or database required. This is a frontend-only web app.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sbom-visualization.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd sbom-visualization
```

### 3. File Structure

```
sbom-visualization/
├── index.html      # The main HTML file
├── styles.css      # Custom CSS for styling
├── script.js       # JavaScript for rendering and interactivity
├── README.md       # This README file
└── assets/          # Any image or asset files you need (optional)
```

### 4. Open `index.html` in a Web Browser

You can now open the `index.html` file in your browser to run the application.

Alternatively, you can serve it using a simple HTTP server like `http-server` if you prefer.

```bash
# Install http-server globally (if you haven't already)
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server .

# Open the app in a browser at http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

### Uploading an SBOM

1. Click the **"Upload your SBOM JSON file"** button.
2. Choose a valid SBOM JSON file to upload.
3. The application will automatically render the components and metadata from the SBOM in a table format.

### Interacting with the Table

- **Search**: Use the search bar to filter components by name, version, description, etc.
- **Sort**: Click on any column header to sort the components based on that attribute. Sorting is applied in ascending or descending order.
- **Download CSV**: Click the **"Download CSV"** button to download the currently displayed data in CSV format.

### Mobile Compatibility

This tool is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes. You can use the app on mobile devices and tablets with a touch-friendly interface.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, with responsive design using flexbox and media queries.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, including handling file uploads, table rendering, and CSV generation.

## Example SBOM JSON

Here is a basic example of an SBOM JSON structure that the tool supports:

```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.2",
  "serialNumber": "urn:uuid:411dafd2-c29f-491a-97d7-e97de5bc2289",
  "version": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2020-08-02T21:21:17Z",
    "tools": [{
      "vendor": "CycloneDX",
      "name": "CycloneDX Maven plugin",
      "version": "2.0.2"
    }],
    "component": {
      "type": "application",
      "bom-ref": "pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-parent@10.0.2",
      "group": "org.keycloak",
      "name": "keycloak-parent",
      "version": "10.0.2",
      "licenses": [{
        "license": {
          "id": "Apache-2.0"
        }
      }]
    }
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "library",
      "bom-ref": "pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on@1.62?type=jar",
      "group": "org.bouncycastle",
      "name": "bcprov-jdk15on",
      "version": "1.62",
      "description": "The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of cryptographic algorithms.",
      "licenses": [{
        "license": {
          "name": "Bouncy Castle Licence",
          "url": "http://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html"
        }
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Note:
The app currently supports SBOM JSONs that are structured according to the CycloneDX format. Make sure your file is formatted similarly for it to render correctly.
